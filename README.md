# Arduino Sketches

This repository contains some Arduino sketches and experiments:

* **Triple RFID Lock**: An electronic lock based on three RFID sensors.
* **Quadruple RFID LED Lock**: An electronic lock based on four RFID sensors that uses [Neopixels](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neopixel-uberguide/the-magic-of-neopixels) to represent the status of the unlock sequence. Fairly similar to the *Triple RFID Lock* sketch.
